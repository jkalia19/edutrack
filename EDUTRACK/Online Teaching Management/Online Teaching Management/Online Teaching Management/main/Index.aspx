In response to the recent challenges being faced by the academic community the world over, the scheme of academic restructuring was initiated in 1996. It is heartening to note that with the successful implementation of innovative schemes under this programmes, we have provided a new lead to the academic community.

The policy of classes for weak students, improvement courses in English for students with rural background, special coaching classes for CET/MBBS/BDS entrance, I.M.A. examinations, intimate teacher-pupil-parent contact and scheme of special lectures by eminent visiting scholars, institution of cash awards and stipends for top brilliant and deserving students, coupled with other welfare schemes for students and better living conditions and improved discipline in the hostels, have fostered a new spirit of hope amongst our staff and students.

Various engineering courses have been running in the College e.g. B.Tech in Computer Science, Electronics & Communications Engg., Civil Engg., Mechanical Engg. Many softwares based on modern techniques in education have been started for CET, PMT and other competitive examinations. The purpose being to make the students compatible for job oriented courses.

The objective has been to serve the needs of the community and the area in a more purposeful and rewarding way in this age of exacting competition. The result of the innovations has been quite encouraging and the College has touched new heights in academics.

About the Khalsa College Amritsar
The edifice of Khalsa College of Engineering & Technology, a grand monument of modern architecture and oriental beauty is located in Ranjit Avenue, just besides the Air-Port Road and at about 3 kms, both from the General Bus Stand and the Railway Station. This unique monument owes its birth to the Khalsa College Society and the Khalsa Dewan who have an urge to educate the Punjabi Society.

Way-back in 19th Century, the Dewan / Society came up with their first big and most significant achievement in the form of establishment of the picturesque Khalsa College, Amritsar on 5th March 1892, with the mission to spread modern education based on Science and Technology on the western lines to keep the regional population abreast with the day-to-day developments of the times. The grandeur and majesty of its building eloquently expresses and speaks volumes about the cherished ideals conceived by its founding fathers and their magnificient materialization, the leaders of the Khalsa Dewan.

Till-date, its oriental architecture enhances inspirations which scale the breadth and richness of imagination from the physical reality to its spiritual ideality. This wonderful monument and premier educational institution of Indian subcontinent has a glorious and rich past.

Being true to the tenets of Sikhism and philosophy of Sikh Gurus, â€œManas Ki Jaat Sabhai Eko Pehchanboâ€ the Khalsa Colleges and their peer Society have always maintained secular credentials, stance and outlook ever since their inception. The Society serves the mankind irrespective of their caste, creed and religion as per the ideals and tenets of the great Sikh religion. This is borne out by the fact that students of all hues and shades have always been welcomed and nurtured with equality in all Khalsa Institutions and the faculty of these Institutions has been always appointed on the basis of merit without any bias what-so-ever.

Truly in consonance with their objectives, mission and dedication, all Khalsa Institutions have achieved excellence in the fields of Education, Sports, Civil and Defence services and now plan to extend its sphere in the technical education.
