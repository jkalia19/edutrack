		       	Online teaching  management (EDUTRACK) ,the main idea is to provide online certified computer education for students through a websote .
                In present generation usage of internet had increased widely where people are getting used to it . on web-platform,people can exchange ideas and communicate with each other and share information.
                                            Through this website we&nbsp; want to prove that&nbsp; learning is not limited 
                                            to books , if internet can provide us entertainment like games, movies other 
                                            services like e-banking then why we are behind in education point of view&nbsp; 
                                            .So our main focus is to make interest of&nbsp; students in&nbsp; online study . 
                                            With the help of this project (EDUTRACK) we are not limited to just books , we 
                                            can study whenever we have our laptops and smartphones in our hand.</p>

                                                understand works better when we show it&nbsp; graphically in multimedia manner 
                                                instead of text forms , we hire professors who beleive in us and are ready to 
                                                make tutorials in animated way. But these tutorials will not work until they get 
                                                a platform , our website works as a platform to them. Our website helps to bring 
                                                teachers and students more closer.</p>
